# MarkovDiscordBot

  This is a discord bot that, when given Discord log files extracted from https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter, produces Markov chains for specific users. 
Although I restricted it to certain users as not all the people in the server had adequate data, one could easily expand this to include more users or to make the 
data collection of users automatic or to add some type of interface for users to add external sources of data.
